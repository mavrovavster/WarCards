-Our team has worked a total of 15 hous on card game project.
-The majority of the difficulty for this project was cooridinating the code each separate person wrote.
-Working as a group was a good expierence for all of us. It was nice having other group members
 to go to if you had an error that you could not figure out, or for just the decrease in hours each person 
put into the project since the work was distributed over four of us.
